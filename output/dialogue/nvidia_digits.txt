[Female Host]: Welcome to our discussion about -08732-001.0 | September 2021NVIDIA DigITS Tutorial...

[Male Guest]: Great point. DIGITS simplifies common deep learning tasks such as managing data, designing and training neural networks on multi-GPU systems and monitoring performance in real time.

[Female Host]: This is particularly important because DIGITS data plug-ins enable a mechanism by which you can extend to ingest data fromcustom sources.

[Male Guest]: DigITS offers a number of model output visualization types such as Image.Classification, Object Detection or Image Segmentation.

[Female Host]: That's fascinating! Let me add that Most of the concepts we need to understand to create a data plugin also apply to writing visualization plugins.

[Male Guest]: In the following sections, each of the important files are defined which need to be created in order to write a plugin.

[Female Host]: This connects to something important: The main section of interest here is the invocation of the setup command from setuptools. The digitsDataPluginSunnybrook plugin is a Python package.

[Male Guest]: It implements a DataIngestion class, which is the only interface between DIGITS and the Sunnybrook plugin.

[Female Host]: The plugin is written in Python and requires the pydicom package. We are recursively including all .html files within the digitsData plugin folder.

[Male Guest]: I see what you mean. The DataIngestion class is the only interface between DIGITS and the Sunnybrook plugin.

[Female Host]: That's fascinating! Let me add that Familiarize yourself with the interface for details about the required methods to implement in this class.

[Male Guest]: The most important ones are: getinferenceform and getdatasettemplate.

[Female Host]: Let me break this down further - The digitsDataPluginSunnybrook/templates/datasettemplate.py file is a Jinja template that defines what you will see in the Web user interface.

[Male Guest]: The DatasetForm class is used to specify a dataset, and the InferenceForm class to specify inference data.

[Female Host]: I agree, and it's worth noting that The plugin is written in Python and requires the pydicom package. We are recursively including all .html files within the digitsData plugin folder.

[Male Guest]: Exactly! The main section of interest here is the invocation of the setup command from setuptools. The digitsDataPluginSunnybrook plugin is a Python package.
