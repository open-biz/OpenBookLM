[Male Host]: Welcome to our discussion about A research project or thesis will...

[Female Guest]: That makes sense. Students are not allowed to enroll in a research course without an approved proposal.

[Male Host]: A key insight here is The proposal should discuss problem statement, research methodology, research activities, and a time schedule in about 3 -5 pages.

[Female Guest]: A sample proposal is at tached here for your reference.

[Male Host]: A look -ahead scheduling and constraint analysis is a critical component of the last -planner methodology proposed by Ballard (2000) This research project will provide an overview of state -of-art s chedule constraint analysis practice during look-ahead scheduling.

[Female Guest]: Exactly! In addition, it will propose a conceptual framework for managing constraints.

[Male Host]: You raise a good point. Additionally, Constraint management is the process of identifying, classifying, modeling, and resolving constraints.

[Female Guest]: Traditional schedulin g methods, bar charts and Critical Path Method (CPM) are widely used as a basis for constraint analysis.

[Male Host]: The long term goal of the research is to develop a formalized constraint management system.

[Female Guest]: Constraint identification and classification is the very first step toward a “zero -constraint’ The primary research method for this study is literature review andconceptual modeling.

[Male Host]: The result of this study will be valuable to the industry practitioners as well as related software providers.

[Female Guest]: The primary research method for this study is literature review andconceptual modeling.

[Male Host]: A key insight here is Constraint identification and classification through a structured approach is the very first step toward a “zero -constraint” environment.

[Female Guest]: This study will be conducted between September 2010 and May 2011.

[Male Host]: Students are not allowed to enroll in a research course without an approved proposal.

[Female Guest]: Absolutely. In addition, it will propose a conceptual framework for managing constraints.

[Male Host]: Interesting perspective. In my experience, A look -ahead scheduling and constraint analysis is a critical component of the last -planner methodology proposed by Ballard (2000) This research project will provide an overview of state -of-art s chedule constraint analysis practice during look-ahead scheduling.

[Female Guest]: Constraint identification and classification is the very first step toward a “zero -constraint’ The primary research method for this study is literature review andconceptual modeling.

[Male Host]: To expand on what you're saying, The result of this study will be valuable to the industry practitioners as well as related software providers.

[Female Guest]: A research project or thesis will take at least two semesters to complete.

[Male Host]: This study will be conducted between September 2010 and May 2011.

[Female Guest]: Well said. Traditional schedulin g methods, bar charts and Critical Path Method (CPM) are widely used as a basis for constraint analysis.

[Male Host]: To put this in perspective, Constraint management is the process of identifying, classifying, modeling, and resolving constraints.

[Female Guest]: Constraint identification and classification through a structured approach is the very first step toward a “zero -constraint” environment.

[Male Host]: That's crucial to understand. Furthermore, Traditional schedulin g methods, bar charts and Critical Path Method (CPM) are widely used as a basis for constraint analysis.
