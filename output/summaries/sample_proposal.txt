A research project or thesis will take at least two semesters to complete.
Students are not allowed to enroll in a research course without an approved proposal.
The proposal should discuss problem statement, research methodology, research activities, and a time schedule in about 3 -5 pages.
A sample proposal is at tached here for your reference.
A look -ahead scheduling and constraint analysis is a critical component of the last -planner methodology proposed by Ballard (2000) This research project will provide an overview of state -of-art s chedule constraint analysis practice during look-ahead scheduling.
In addition, it will propose a conceptual framework for managing constraints.
Constraint management is the process of identifying, classifying, modeling, and resolving constraints.
Traditional schedulin g methods, bar charts and Critical Path Method (CPM) are widely used as a basis for constraint analysis.
The long term goal of the research is to develop a formalized constraint management system.
Constraint identification and classification is the very first step toward a “zero -constraint’ The primary research method for this study is literature review andconceptual modeling.
The result of this study will be valuable to the industry practitioners as well as related software providers.
The primary research method for this study is literature review andconceptual modeling.
Constraint identification and classification through a structured approach is the very first step toward a “zero -constraint” environment.
This study will be conducted between September 2010 and May 2011.
