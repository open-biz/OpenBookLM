An Overview Of DIG ITS.
DIGITS simplifies common deep learning tasks such as managing data, designing and training neural networks on multi-GPU systems and monitoring performance in real time.
DIGITS  data plug-ins enable a mechanism by which you can extend DIG ITS to ingest data fromcustom sources.
DigITS offers a number of model output visualization types such as Image.Classification, Object Detection or Image Segmentation.
Most of the concepts we need to understand to create a data plugin also apply to writing visualization plugins.
In the following sections, each of the important files are defined which need to be created in order to write a plugin.
The main section of interest here is the invocation of the setup command from setuptools.
The digitsDataPluginSunnybrook plugin is a Python package.
It implements a DataIngestion class, which is the only interface between DIGITS and the Sunnybrook plugin.
The plugin is written in Python and requires the pydicom package.
We are recursively including all .html files within the digitsData plugin folder.
The DataIngestion class is the only interface between DIGITS and the Sunnybrook plugin.
Familiarize yourself with the interface for details about the required methods to implement in this class.
The most important ones are: get_inference_form and get_dataset_template.
The digitsDataPluginSunnybrook/templates/dataset_template.py file is a Jinja template that defines what you will see in the Web user interface.
The DatasetForm class is used to specify a dataset, and the InferenceForm class to specify inference data.
