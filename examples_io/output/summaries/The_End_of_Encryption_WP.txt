**The End of Encryption? â€“ The Era of Quantum Computers**

**Summary**

In this paper, we examine the impact of quantum computers on traditional encryption methods. Quantum computers have the
    potential to break most standard mathematical cryptography problems, making traditional cryptography obsolete. However,
    researchers are already searching for potential solutions, such as symmetric key quantum resistance, multivariate
    cryptography, and lattice-based cryptography.

**Introduction**

In the 21st century, information technology has become an integral part of our lives. The number of organizations using
    the internet is growing every year, with 93% of all enterprises using the internet by the end of 2020. The use of IT
    systems is a great help when it comes to high processes and tasks with high computational needs and real-time
    communication or file-sharing with geographically distant entities. However, the high prevalence of information and
    communication technologies (ICT) has its own drawbacks.

**Machine-Based Identification**

Machine-based identification procedures can be divided into two main groups: traditional personal identification
    techniques and biometric methods. Traditional personal identification techniques include knowledge-based and possession-
    based procedures. Biometric methods, such as fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, and iris scanning, are also
    spreading rapidly. However, biometric systems are subject to cost/benefit analysis, and the final conclusion is heavily
    influenced by the field of application and budgetary constraints.

**Understanding Passwords**

Passwords are a means of identification that can be used independently of their original users. The authentication
    process does not distinguish between true and fake users, making it essential to tackle password safety consciously.
    Password security can be supplemented by multi-factor or multi-step authentication. The purpose of multifactor
    identification is to uniquely identify the user.

**Encryption**

Encryption is a method of protecting data by converting it into a code that can only be deciphered with a key. Symmetric
    encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public key for
    encryption and a private key for decryption. However, quantum computers can easily break most standard mathematical
    cryptography problems, making traditional cryptography obsolete.

**Quantum Computers**

Quantum computers are computing devices that perform calculations based on quantum mechanical phenomena. A quantum
    computer may be able to perform calculations efficiently that would be practically unsolvable with traditional digital
    computers or could take years or decades to solve. Quantum bits (qubits) are the basic unit of information in quantum
    informatics, and they can represent 0, 1, or a superposition of any ratio of states 0 to 1 with a certain probability of
    0 and a certain probability of 1.

**Quantum Apocalypse**

The advent of quantum computers is making the currently used encryption methods obsolete. Brute force is not a
    vocabulary that can be used in connection with them. Quantum computers will cause a serious upheaval, what experts call
    a "quantum apocalypse," since methodologies used on/for traditional computers will no longer be able to provide safety.

**Quantum Cryptography**

Quantum cryptography is a fundamental challenge classic cryptography, since quantum computers can easily break most
    standard mathematical cryptography problems, such as factoring and discrete logarithms, by using quantum mechanics'
    physics. Researchers are already searching for potential solutions, such as symmetric key quantum resistance,
    multivariate cryptography, and lattice-based cryptography.

**Summary**

In conclusion, quantum computers represent the future rather than the present for the public. However, in many
    countries, both the state and large research institutes are already working on developing them. If the weaknesses of
    quantum computers can be eradicated and their reliability can be improved, the encryptions that have been used will soon
    be obsolete.
