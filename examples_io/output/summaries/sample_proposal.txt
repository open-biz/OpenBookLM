This research proposal outlines a comprehensive review of constraint management in construction projects, with a focus
    on developing a conceptual framework for total constraint management. The proposal is divided into five sections:
    Introduction, Problem Statement, Objectives, Preliminary Literature Review, and Methodology.

**Introduction**

Every construction project is unique and has its own operating environment and sets of technical requirements. As a
    result, the execution of a construction project is subject to numerous constraints that limit the commencement or
    progression of field operations, which invariably have significant negative impacts on overall project performance. By
    definition, constraints refer to any condition, such as temporal/spatial limitations and safety/quality concerns, which
    may prevent a project from achieving its goals. Successful execution and control of a construction project rely on
    effective identification and management of constraints through master planning and short-term look-ahead scheduling.

**Problem Statement**

The importance of developing a constraint-free and reliable work plan has long been recognized by the industry. However,
    numerous construction projects are still plagued by delays and cost overruns, which can frequently be traced to
    ineffective identification and treatment of constraints. First, when a constraint is not properly identified during
    scheduling, subsequent conflicts in the field are inevitable. Today's projects are becoming more and more technically
    complex and logistically challenging, which exposes construction operations to even more complex constraints. Second,
    the traditional scheduling methods, bar charts and Critical Path Method (CPM), which are widely used as a basis for
    constraint analysis, greatly limit our capability in modeling and resolving constraints during look-ahead scheduling.

**Objectives**

The long-term goal of this research is to develop a formalized constraint management system. Constraint management is
    defined herein as the process of identifying, classifying, modeling, and resolving constraints. The objective of the
    current study is to provide a comprehensive review of literatures and industry practices in relation to constraint
    analysis and outline a conceptual framework for constraint management. Particularly, the study has the following sub-
    objectives:

1. To provide a comprehensive review of sources and characteristics of constraints typically found in construction
    projects; 2. To develop a constraint classification method for easier constraint identification and modeling; 3. To
    review current industry practices and researches in regards to constraint modeling; 4. To outline a conceptual framework
    for total constraint management.

The result of this study will be valuable to the industry practitioners as well as related software providers in
    developing better practice and tools for constraint management and look-ahead scheduling.

**Preliminary Literature Review**

A preliminary literature review shows that past studies are primarily focused on understanding and modeling a particular
    type of constraint, such as technological, contractual, resource, spatial, and information constraints. Limited progress
    has been made on classifying various constraints according to their characteristics in a comprehensive manner. In terms
    of modeling and resolving constraints, various approaches have been recommended. For example, many CPM-based methods are
    applied to deal with time-related constraints; knowledge-based systems were used to automate work plan generation;
    network-based optimization algorithms were developed to resolve constraints; and databases and visualization techniques,
    such as 3D, 4D, and Virtual Reality (VR), are used to communicate and visualize constraints. What is missing from the
    past studies is a comprehensive and structured approach in managing constraints in construction projects.

**Methodology**

The primary research method for this study is literature review and conceptual modeling. Constraint identification and
    classification through a structured approach is the very first step toward a "zero-constraint" environment. This study
    will first review various types of constraints in construction and their characteristics. Based on this understanding, a
    classification method will be developed to categorize constraint factors for the purpose of constraint identification
    and modeling. In the second stage of this study, existing constraint modeling methods will be identified based on a
    comprehensive review of current industry practices and academic researches. Finally, once the constraint classification
    and modeling techniques are identified, a conceptual framework for total constraint management will be outlined. This
    study will be conducted between September 2010 and May 2011.

In conclusion, this research proposal outlines a comprehensive review of constraint management in construction projects,
    with a focus on developing a conceptual framework for total constraint management. The study aims to provide a
    comprehensive review of sources and characteristics of constraints typically found in construction projects, develop a
    constraint classification method for easier constraint identification and modeling, review current industry practices
    and researches in regards to constraint modeling, and outline a conceptual framework for total constraint management.
    The result of this study will be valuable to the industry practitioners as well as related software providers in
    developing better practice and tools for constraint management and look-ahead scheduling.
